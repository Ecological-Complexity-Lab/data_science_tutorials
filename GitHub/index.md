# Exercises

## Profile

1. go to your GitHub profile, edit it including an avatar. We are a large team, and a bunch of colored cubes is not nice to look at...
2. Further [customize your profile](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile).
3. Go to https://github.com/orgs/MadagascarEEID/people, click your name and make your membership in the organization public.

## Basic GitHub workflow

**Because GitHub is a collaborative tool this exercise is better done in pairs or groups.**

1. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to use in some of the next stages.
2. Create your own repository within your private account (not within the Magascar organization otherwise we will have a mess...). Try to customize it by giving a description, etc.
3. Clone the repository to your local computers using GitHub Desktop.
4. On your local computers, add code to the repository, commit changes and push. See tutorials above for help.
5. Make changes to the code locally, commit and push again.
6. Invite a partner to your respective repos and manage access (read/write/admin).
7. Pull your partner’s repo to your local computer and make changes in one or more files.
8. Commit and push your partner’s repository (you will need to give writing permissions in stage 6).
9. Pull the repository after your partner made changes.
10. repeat steps 7-10 a couple of times, see if you can do that without creating conflicts. Remember to pull the repository after your partner made changes, before making changes and pushing again.

## Project management

1. Open issues in yours and your partner’s repos, comment on them, add labels. Try to mention people using @ and other issues using #.
2. Open a [project board](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-project-boards). Set up columns and fill some cards.
3. Link the issues to the project board columns, and work with labels and [milestones](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-milestones).

## Pull requests

[See some guidance](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

1. Open a new branch
2. Edit code and commit it to your new branch.
3. Open a pull request
4. Have your partner look at the pull request and merge.

## Documentation

You can find basic instructions for markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### README

You are currently reading a README. Your repository’s readme file which is the welcome information of your repository. Create one. Here is a cool example: https://github.com/Day8/re-frame#readme.

### Wiki

Using Wikis is extremely important because our projects are collaborative with many people and because the knowledge should be preserved even when people leave the projects. It is also a great way for you to essentially advance writing your paper. [Wiki example](Here are examples of some Wikis: https://github.com/Ecological-Complexity-Lab/infomap_ecology/wiki).

* Create Wiki pages in your repository, and add pages to them using the markdown language. These pages are the knowledge base for your project.  Your Wiki pages should include formatted text, links, figures, tables, inline code and code chunks. Also try to add internal links to other pages inside the Wiki.
