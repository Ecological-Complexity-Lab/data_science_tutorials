# Data science tutorials

This repository has a collection of classes, tutorials and tips for programming and data science with R and Rstudio. I have started this so my student will have access to immediate knowledge they need. From time to time and as needed I update this repository.

It is needless to say that there are so so many amazing resources out there, which I also used to write some of the code here.
