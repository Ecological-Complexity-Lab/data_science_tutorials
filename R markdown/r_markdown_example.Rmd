#Basic R Markdown examples

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

A references example: See @Baskerville2011-mt


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Running from a source R file.
Between <<>> put the name of the chunk from `source_file.R`.
```{r libs, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
<<load_libs>>
```

Plot something by calling code from the source file:

```{r plotting}
<<plot_prices>>
```

# Caching.
This is very important when you have code that takes a long time to run and you do not want to re-run it every time you kint the document. See [tutorial](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/#cache).

## Cache example
First time you knit, it will run the `modularity` chunk and put it in the cache in folder r_markdown_example_cache. Then the second time you knit it will skip the `modularity` chunk but still plt the modules because it reads it from the cache.

```{r modularity, cache=TRUE}
library(bipartite)
Q_obs <- computeModules(memmott1999)
```

```{r plot modules, dependson='modularity'}
plotModuleWeb(Q_obs)
```
